== Description ==

Wiredrive WordPress Plug-in Features:

* Customizable dimensions
* Displays video or image, title and first credit of each asset
* Multiple layout options
* Show or hide thumbnail tray
* Customizable color options

* Click through images or play them as a slideshow
* Leverage assets already uploaded to Library

Functionality Specs:

* Displays video, title and first credit of each asset
* The active video's thumbnail will have a border
* Videos play through Flash in Firefox, Internet Explorer and Chrome. If Flash isn't installed, the user is prompted to install Safari or Flash
* In Safari, videos play natively using the HTML5 player 
* In Firefox, IE, Chrome and Safari (including iOS) the feed will play sequentially
* Displays the first item's poster frame
* If the feed does not come from Wiredrive an error is returned
* If the feed is empty an error is returned
* If the feed does not exist an error is returned
* Works with both MRSS feeds and presentation URLs.

Known Issues:

* A one pixel border around the Flash player is hardcoded into the Flash player. Attempts to remove it have been unsuccessful. We are working to fix this issue.
* The poster frame will stretch to fill the player for browsers that use Flash if the file's aspect ratio differs from the dimensions you've set for the player. This is an issue with the Flash player. We are working to fix this issue.
* When using the new grid mode on an iPad or iPhone, sequential playback does not work.

Untested:

* Video playback on Android. Android currently plays .mp4 and H.264 files. No plans to play .mov files have been announced.
* Playback for formats that Safari and Flash do not natively support (e.g., .avi or .divx).
